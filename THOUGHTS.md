# Mina-anons
Mina-anons is a zero-knowledge social layer which will empower privacy and decentralizations for web3 and web2.

DAOs, across EVM blockchains (*and soon non-EVM chains and even web2 identities*), can now support  **anonymous** social interactions (i.e:  posting, voting, gating) thanks to Mina's ZK capabilities.

This project is sparked by recent ECDSA support by o1js.

## Web 1, 2, 3 then Web ZK

Ever since the internet (world wide web) was invented, internet has been always been social, as evidently seen in web 2.0 era. From relay chat, email and social networks, the social components of internet has come very far.

HOWEVER, *anonymity, privacy and decentralization* is still not fully supported.

NOW, Web3's social era is just getting started with formation of DAOs and communities. However, most of DAOs social activities (proposals, votes, reporting, etc) are still relying on centralized web2 solutions. 

AND, since blockchains are decentralized but they are not privacy friendly and all interactions are out in the public. 
  
This project imagines a **Web ZK** where *anonymity, privacy and decentralization* can be supported easily by integrating its zero-knowledge social layer into any Web3 on any blockchain.

## How does it work?

Mina-anons works by leveraging Mina's ZK capabilities, especially, ECDSA support and recursive proofs. Users can prove their identities anonymously via ZK proofs and do social actions (voting, posting, reporting, etc) in both privacy-friendly and decentralized ways.

There are 2 core components in Mina-anons:

**#1 accounts**  
Accounts are any EVM chain account (via ECDSA support) which can generate ZK proof through Mina to prove that they meet the criteria for being a part of an entity.  _Later on, other non-EVM chains will be supported by leveraging Mina gadgets (i.e: ed25519 for Solana)._

This proof is  **anonymous**  as the EVM account is a private input, but the proof can be verified that it is generated by an unknown account which meets the criteria.  
  
For instance, a NFT community host can define criteria to be part of the group. Users can join the group anonymously by proving that they meet the criteria to generate ZK proofs. Then with the ZK proofs, they can proceed to do other social actions (voting, posting, reporting, etc).  
  
**#2 actions**  
Actions are any social actions (voting, posting, reporting, etc) which will be anonymous while still ensuring that these actions are done by accounts meeting the defined criteria.  
  
The social actions are added on as  **recursive proofs**  on top of the earlier account proof. These proofs can be persisted on Arweave/IPFS for follow-on verifications.  
  
For instance, members, after proving that they own certain NFTs, can do various social actions anonymously.

## Architecture

Further building upon "accounts" and "actions" which are just Mina ZK proofs, Mina-anons dApp/Frontend is to be NextJS and ReactJS which can be run by users on their own for true decentralization. Persistence needs would be served through decentralized storage provider Arweave.

Extensibility of the social stack would be paid special attention as Mina-anons would focus on the core components.

**Accounts**

Accounts are any EVM chain account (via ECDSA support) which can generate ZK proof through Mina to prove that they meet the criteria for being a part of an entity. Later on, other non-EVM chains will be supported by leveraging Mina gadgets (i.e: ed25519 for Solana).
  
This proof is anonymous as the EVM account is a private input, but the proof can be verified that it is generated by an unknown account which meets the criteria.  
  
**Actions**  
Actions are any social actions (voting, posting, reporting, etc) which will be anonymous while still ensuring that these actions are done by accounts meeting the defined criteria.  
  
The social actions are added on as  **recursive proofs**  on top of the earlier account proof. These proofs can be persisted on Arweave/IPFS for follow-on verifications.

**Frontend**

Frontend will be built using ReactJS and NextJS. It will be structured with care so that it can be deployed easily with a few clicks to hosts such as Vercel. There will be a detailed deployment guide as well.  
  
**Storage**

Storage of proofs for follow-on verifications will be stored using Arweave. For relational data, WeaveDB will be used.  
  
**Extensibility through plugins**  
Plugins leverage conventions of NextJS  **Pages folder**  structure and routing. Each plugin contains a package of social actions.  
  
For instance, for a voting plugin, posting a poll, voting for a poll, and relevant UIs are all organized in a folder inside of  **Pages folder**.  
  
So plugins can be easily published and dragged in as a folder.
