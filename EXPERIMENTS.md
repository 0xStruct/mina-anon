# MVPs for Mina-anons
This file will track of experiments... ideas/mvps to be built to showcase the ZK social layer. The ideas will primarily be fun, light but potentially wide-reaching through their viral-ness.

## Whistle-blowing for ruggers
 
Inspired by once viral YikYak ([https://yikyak.com/](https://yikyak.com/)) app, the mvp will allow exposing of ruggers while guaranteeing anonymity but with anonymous proofs about exposers' credibility/criteria.

## Anonymous confessions

Inspired by [https://twitter.com/coinfessions](https://twitter.com/coinfessions)  with 181K followers)

Users would be able to submit confessions via zkApp anonymously and a Twitter account will curate and broadcast these confessions for wider reach through relevant social graphs.

## Anonymous AMA/LMK/poll app

This mvp is intented for used by Twitter users where they share a link to solicit questions and complementaries from their followers.

This social phenomenom is actually very common. By leveraging this, the zkApp and Mina's ZK tech would be augmenting one of the top web2 social graphs.

It would be great to be able to support proof of Twitter ownership and follow anonymously for this mvp.
